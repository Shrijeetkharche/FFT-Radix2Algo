# FFT-Radix2Algo
The Objective of the project is to compute the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) using the Decimation in Time Radix 2 FFT algorithm with the help of Hardware Description Language.  
The Heirarchy of the codes are as follows:
  - tb_FFT.vhd
    - FFT2.vhd (or) FFT4.vhd (or) FFT8.vhd (or) FFT16.vhd
      - Butterfly_Stage.vhd
